The dashboard's main aim is to determine:

âž¡ Gender distribution of passengers across all flights.

âž¡ Passengers vary by their nationality.

âž¡ The Airport that has the highest no.of flight departures.

âž¡ The most common flight status for all flights.

âž¡ The Pilot who has the highest no.of flights under their name.

âž¡ Distribution of flight departures by the airport continent.

âž¡ Country that has the highest no.of Passenger count.

âž¡ No.of Passengers in each age group.

âž¡ Trends in flight status over time.

âž¡ No.of Passengers traveled by each continent.

âž¡ Flight Status Distribution by Airport Continent.

To achieve this goal, I have taken the following actions:

â–¶ I changed the Departure Date column from Text to proper Date data type.
â–¶ Created the Calculated column called Age group to categorize the age into groups, using the DAX Formula called Switch.
â–¶ Created the column named Departure Indicator, Using the IF Function.

ðŸ”¸ Using Visuals like Charts, bar charts, pie charts, line charts, etc.; I was able to find patterns right away and understand the data clearly.
